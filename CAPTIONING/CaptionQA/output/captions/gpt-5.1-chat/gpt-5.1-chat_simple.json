Here is a detailed description:\n\n---\n\n**Top Section \u2014 Title and Explanatory Text**\n\nThe title reads:  \n\"Why DeviceMesh is Useful\"\n\nBelow the title is a paragraph explaining that **DeviceMesh** helps with multi\u2011dimensional parallelism, where parallelism must work both across hosts and within each host. The text mentions that DeviceMesh simplifies the creation of 2\u2011D meshes that connect devices within each host and across hosts. It contrasts this with the manual setup needed when DeviceMesh is not used.\n\n---\n\n**Embedded Image / Diagram**\n\nThere is a block diagram (a simple grid layout).  \nIt visually represents 2\u2011D parallelism across multiple nodes:\n\n\u2022 Two horizontal rows of devices labeled as \u201cnode2\u201d and \u201cnoden\u201d.  \n\u2022 Each row shows devices D0, D1, D2, D3 and D4, D5, D6, D7.  \n\u2022 Vertical dashed connections link corresponding devices across nodes, forming a column\u2011based communication pattern.  \n\u2022 Colored arrows highlight the relationships:  \n  - Turquoise arrows connect devices horizontally (e.g., D0 \u2192 D1 \u2192 D2 \u2192 D3)  \n  - Gray vertical dashed arrows connect devices across nodes (D0 with D4, D1 with D5, etc.)\n\nIt illustrates how a 2\u2011D mesh organizes devices both locally and across nodes.\n\n---\n\n**Main Explanation Above Code Block**\n\nA paragraph explains that without DeviceMesh, users must manually configure NCCL communicators and CUDA device assignments. The text introduces a code snippet that demonstrates manually implementing a hybrid sharding 2\u2011D parallel pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Code Block**\n\nA large Python code block follows. It includes:\n\n\u2022 Imports:  \n  - `os`  \n  - `torch`  \n  - `torch.distributed as dist`\n\n\u2022 It reads rank and world size from environment variables.  \n\u2022 Initializes a process group using the \"nccl\" backend.  \n\u2022 Sets the CUDA device to the local rank.\n\n**Shard Groups Creation**\n\n\u2022 Gets the number of devices.  \n\u2022 Divides devices into two shard groups, e.g.:  \n  - [0, 1, 2, 3]  \n  - [4, 5, 6, 7]  \n\u2022 Creates process groups for these shards.\n\n**Replicate Groups Creation**\n\n\u2022 Calculates replicate groups by stepping across devices with a stride equal to the shard factor.  \n\u2022 Creates process groups where devices like (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7) are grouped.\n\nThe goal is to manually define a 2\u2011D parallel pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Final Paragraph**\n\nExplains that to run this code, one can use PyTorch Elastic.\n\n---\n\n**Command Line Example**\n\nA command is shown:\n\n```\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --rdzv_id=100 --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:29400 2d_setup.py\n```\n\nThis demonstrates launching the distributed job with 8 processes per node.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, I can also summarize the technical purpose, rewrite the code for clarity, or explain how DeviceMesh replaces this manual setup.",

Cosine is drawn in red and sine in purple.\n\n- Below, there is another example labeled \u201cEx\u201d, with x = cos(3t) and y = sin(3t).  \n  The substitution u = 3t is written, showing that as t goes from 0 to 2\u03c0, u goes from 0 to 6\u03c0.  \n  A pink sketch of a circle traced multiple times (three loops) illustrates how the graph repeats.\n\n- On the right side is another example:  \n  x = 2 cos t \u2013 1  \n  y = 2 sin t + 1  \n  with 0 \u2264 t \u2264 2\u03c0.  \n  This describes a circle of radius 2 centered at (-1, 1).\n\n- A large pink circle is drawn to represent this shifted circle.  \n  Important points are marked:  \n  At t = 0, the point is (1, 1).  \n  At t = \u03c0/2, the point is (-1, 3).  \n  The center (-1, 1) is indicated with axes drawn in blue.\n\n- On the far right, the equations are rewritten:  \n  x + 1 = 2 cos t  \n  y \u2013 1 = 2 sin t  \n  The variables u and v are written next to the left side of these equations.  \n  A small table lists t, x, and y values for t = 0 and t = \u03c0/2.\n\nOverall, the image is a set of visual notes explaining how parametric trigonometric equations generate circles, how changing parameters (like multiplying t or shifting x and y) affects the graph, and how to interpret the geometry of the parametric motion.",

This suggests that key/value data circulate among devices in a ring pattern while each device keeps its own query block.\n\n**Sub\u2011figure (b):**\n- This figure shows a more detailed flow of computation across blocks.\n- On the left, a vertical stack labeled \u201cQuery Outer Loop\u201d contains several query blocks (Query1, Query2, Query3, Query4) shown as purple boxes.\n- Across the top, a sequence of \u201cBlockwise FeedForward\u201d modules (blue boxes) is arranged horizontally.\n- Below them, a matching sequence of \u201cBlockwise Attention\u201d modules (orange boxes) is shown.\n- Beneath these attention boxes is a row of key/value blocks: Key1/Value1, Key2/Value2, Key3/Value3, Key4/Value4 (yellow dashed boxes).\n- Arrows indicate the flow of computation:\n  - A query block (from the left side) is fed into each attention module.\n  - Each attention module interacts with a corresponding key/value block.\n  - Key/value blocks move from left to right, with arrows showing \u201ccompute, send to next device\u201d and \u201creceive from previous device,\u201d reflecting circular communication between devices.\n- A horizontal dashed line labeled \u201cKey and Value Inner Loop\u201d underlines the key/value block row, showing their iterative movement.\n\n**Caption summary:**\nThe caption explains:\n- **Top (a):** The model architecture matches a standard Transformer but reorganizes how computation is distributed. Each device holds a query block while key/value blocks travel through devices in a ring, enabling block\u2011by\u2011block attention and feedforward computation.\n- **Bottom (b):** Each device performs one iteration of an outer loop over queries, while key/value blocks rotate among devices. The figure illustrates how blocks move, how self\u2011attention is computed using query/key/value blocks, and how feedforward layers follow.\n- The caption also discusses computational cost, FLOP estimates, and communication requirements for key/value block transfers.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also summarize the technical idea, rewrite the caption more cleanly, or explain the algorithm.",

The goal is to take as few photographs as possible between time 0 and T so that every duck is photographed at least once while it is dancing.\n\nThe image gives an example with n = 4 and T = 6. A small table is presented with three rows and four columns under column headers i = 0, 1, 2, 3. The second row, labeled si, lists the start times of the ducks\u2019 intervals as 1, 0, 2.5, and 3. The third row, labeled ti, lists the end times as 4.5, 2, 4, and 5.\n\nTo the right of the table is a horizontal timeline labeled \u201cTime,\u201d with four horizontal line segments representing the dance intervals of the four ducks. Each segment has a filled dot at each endpoint to show that the intervals are closed. The top segment is the longest, spanning roughly from time 1 to time 4.5.

Their optical centers are labeled O on the left and O\u2032 on the right. A 3D point P is above and between them. Rays from O and O\u2032 pass through P and continue into the image planes of each camera.\n\nEach camera has an image plane drawn as a rectangular sheet positioned in front of the camera center. On the left image plane, the projection of point P is labeled p. On the right image plane, the corresponding projection is labeled p\u2032.\n\nA shaded triangular region connects O, O\u2032, and P. This region is labeled as the epipolar plane. The line segment connecting O and O\u2032 is labeled baseline.\n\nWhere the baseline intersects each image plane, a point is labeled e on the left and e\u2032 on the right. These represent the epipoles.\n\nFrom P, several red lines are drawn to each image plane, illustrating how the epipolar plane intersects the image planes. These intersections form epipolar lines. On the left plane, the epipolar line passing through p is labeled l. On the right plane, the corresponding epipolar line through p\u2032 is labeled l\u2032.\n\nBelow the diagram, explanatory text describes the concepts:\n\u2022 Images p and p\u2032 are the projections of point P as seen by two cameras with centers O and O\u2032.  \n\u2022 All five points p, p\u2032, P, O, and O\u2032 lie in the same epipolar plane.  \n\u2022 The epipolar constraint states that the possible match for p must lie on the epipolar line l\u2032 in the other image, and vice versa.\n\nOverall, the image visually illustrates how geometry constrains where a point observed in one camera must appear in the other.",

In the first image (A), the cat is 2 units tall and sits with its base at coordinate (2,2). In the second image (B), the cat has grown by 50%, is sitting on a taller cat tree, and its orientation is mirrored horizontally. The problem asks for a sequence of transformations\u2014using only translate(x,y) and scale(x,y)\u2014that moves the cat from its position in (A) to its position in (B). The text also notes that scale values can be negative (allowing mirroring), and that the leftmost illustration shows the cat from image A positioned with its base at the origin for convenience.\n\nBelow the text are three images:\n\n1. **Leftmost small image**  \n   This is a standalone picture of the cat with its base aligned at the origin of a coordinate grid. The grid has evenly spaced dashed lines. The cat sits upright, facing slightly to the right, and the cat is about two grid units tall. The axes are shown with arrows pointing right (x\u2011axis) and upward (y\u2011axis).\n\n2. **Center image labeled (A)**  \n   This depicts the original situation.  \n   - There is a coordinate grid with dashed horizontal and vertical lines.  \n   - A cat tree is drawn with a vertical post and a horizontal platform at about height y = 2.  \n   - The cat sits on this platform slightly left of center.  \n   - The cat is the same small size as in the leftmost reference image.  \n   - The base of the cat appears to be positioned around coordinate (2,2), consistent with the description.\n\n3. **Right image labeled (B)**  \n   This shows the second situation a year later.  \n   - The coordinate grid is present again.  \n   - A taller cat tree with a higher horizontal platform is drawn on the right side.  \n   - A shorter tree appears to the left.  \n   - The cat is now larger: its height is about 1.5 times the cat in image (A), matching the stated 50% increase.  \n   - The cat is mirrored, facing the opposite direction compared to the cat in (A).  \n   - The cat sits on the top of the taller platform on the right side of the figure.\n\nOverall, the images visually demonstrate the cat\u2019s starting position and size, and the final position, size, and mirrored orientation, illustrating the transformation problem.",

Here is a detailed description:\n\nThe top half of the figure shows grids of video frames demonstrating the output of two systems: a dense baseline model and an approach labeled SVG (Sparse VideoGen). Two separate video\u2011generation models are visualized: CogVideoX\u2011v1.5\u2011I2V (top rows) and HunyuanVideo\u2011T2V (middle rows). For each model, the SVG results appear in a row below the dense results for comparison.\n\nTop-left block: A sequence of frames showing a blue boat traveling across the ocean near a large cruise ship. The images progress horizontally, showing gentle waves and a stable background with birds in the sky.\n\nTop-right block: Frames depicting a book engulfed in flames. The flames are dynamic, spreading upward and outward across the pages as the sequence advances.\n\nMiddle-left block: Frames showing several swallows collecting mud and carrying it to a wooden structure under an eave. The camera angle is slightly low, and the birds interact with the environment.\n\nMiddle-right block: Frames showing several ducks lying in a muddy pit. They occasionally groom their feathers. The setting is calm, with wet ground and water reflecting the ducks' movements.\n\nUnder these video examples, a caption explains that SVG reproduces videos closely matching the originals under various scenarios: minor scene changes, major scene changes, rare object interactions, and frequent object interactions.\n\nBelow the video rows is a horizontal bar chart titled \u201cFigure 7.\u201d It breaks down the computation time for generating a 5.3\u2011second 720p video with HunyuanVideo. The bars represent runtime contributions of different components: baseline, efficient kernel, sparse attention, and FP8. Each design yields incremental speedups, with total acceleration marked as 2.33\u00d7. The left side of the chart starts at 0 and the right side near 2400 seconds.\n\nTo the right of the bar chart is Table 2. It shows inference speedups for customized QK\u2011norm and RoPE compared to PyTorch implementations. The table lists four frame counts (8, 9, 10, 11). QK\u2011norm speedups range around 7.4\u00d7, while RoPE speedups range from about 14.5\u00d7 to 16.5\u00d7.\n\nThe overall layout is academic and visually dense, combining experimental results, quantitative analysis, and qualitative comparisons.

  "doc_118": "The image contains two main parts: a 3\u2011D plot and a mathematical diagram, along with explanatory text from what appears to be a probability or statistics textbook.\n\nHere is a detailed description:\n\n1. At the top, there is a 3\u2011D surface plot of the joint density function f(x, y) = (1 / (2\u03c0)) * exp(\u2212(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/2).  \n   - The surface is shaped like a symmetric bell centered at the origin.  \n   - The height represents the value of the density.  \n   - The axes labeled x and y range from about \u22123 to 3.  \n   - The vertical axis represents f(x, y) and goes up to about 0.15.  \n   - The surface is colored, transitioning from dark blue at low values to yellow at the peak.\n\n2. Under the figure is the caption:  \n   \u201cFigure 3: The joint density function f(x, y) = 1/(2\u03c0) e^(\u2212(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/2) is rotationally symmetric.\u201d\n\n3. Below the plot is mathematical text explaining that because the joint density is rotationally symmetric, any rotation T of the plane leaves the distribution of (X, Y) unchanged. It shows the equality of probabilities:  \n   P[(X, Y) \u2208 A] = P[(X, Y) \u2208 T(A)].\n\n4. The text introduces a random variable Z = aX + bY and considers the half\u2011plane A = { (x, y) | ax + by \u2264 t }.\n\n5. It then shows that this half\u2011plane can be rotated into another set:  \n   T(A) = { (x, y) | x \u2264 t / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) }.\n\n6. Below this is **Figure 4**, which contains two side\u2011by\u2011side 2\u2011D diagrams:\n   - The left diagram shows the coordinate plane with axes x and y centered at (0, 0).  \n     A slanted line ax + by = t is drawn, forming the boundary of a half\u2011plane.  \n     The shortest distance from the line to the origin is labeled t / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).  \n   - The right diagram shows the rotated version of this region, where the boundary is now a vertical line x = t / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), and the half\u2011plane is to the left of this line.\n\n7. Beneath the diagrams, the accompanying explanation states that the rotation does not change the probability of the event, and therefore P[Z \u2264 t] = P[ sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) X \u2264 t ].  \n   This culminates in the conclusion that Z has a normal distribution with variance a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nIf you'd like, I can summarize the mathematical idea, explain the figures intuitively, or rewrite the text in simpler terms.",
  "doc_119": "The image shows a page from a textbook on graph theory. It contains text, diagrams of graphs, section headers, and example questions. Here is a detailed description:\n\nThe top of the page has the section title \u201c1.1 Formal definitions.\u201d The text explains what a graph is, beginning with the definition of an undirected graph, which is defined by a set of vertices V and a set of edges E. It describes that vertices correspond to small circles in a figure and edges are the line segments between them. The example uses V = {A, B, C, D} and E = {{A, B}, {A, B}, {A, C}, {B, C}, {B, D}, {C, D}} and notes that E is treated as a multiset in the example, though normally they will use sets so no multiple edges remain.\n\nThe text then introduces directed graphs, explaining that a directed edge represents a one-way relationship. It defines a directed edge as an ordered pair (u, v).

How about the longest path, assuming no house is visited twice?\u201d\n\n\u2022 The text then explains that they assume paths are simple (no repeated vertices), and asks why you wouldn\u2019t revisit house 2 when traveling from 1 to 3 via 2.  \n\u2022 Next it defines a *cycle* (or *circuit*) as a sequence of edges that starts and ends at the same vertex, using a sequence v\u2081, v\u2082, \u2026, v\u2099, v\u2081 with all v\u2019s distinct except the repeat at the start/end.\n\n\u2022 Another \u201cConcept check!\u201d appears:  \n  \u201cGive a cycle starting at house 1 in G\u2083.\u201d\n\n\u2022 A new scenario is described: instead of traveling from 1 to 3 as quickly as possible, the reader takes a longer stroll 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 1 \u2192 4 \u2192 3.  \n\u2022 This is used to define a *walk* (a sequence of edges with possibly repeated vertices).  \n\u2022 It also defines a *tour* as a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex. An example tour is {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,1}.\n\n\u2022 At the bottom of the page, there is a small table summarizing properties:  \n  Columns:  \n  \u2013 no repeated vertices  \n  \u2013 no repeated edges  \n  \u2013 start = end  \n  Rows: Walk, Path, Tour, Cycle  \n  Various check marks indicate which constraints apply to each.

  "doc_121": "The image is a technical, cross\u2011sectional illustration showing how sediment is deposited inside a deep reservoir. It depicts the shape and behavior of a delta as it advances from an upstream river channel into the deeper water of the reservoir. While it is not a photograph, it is a scientific diagram with labeled geomorphic features.\n\nHere is a detailed description:\n\nThe left side of the diagram shows the upstream river channel entering the reservoir. The original bed or valley profile trends gently downward toward the right. As sediment is carried into the reservoir, it forms a wedge\u2011shaped delta that extends from the inflow point toward deeper water.\n\nSeveral distinct zones of the delta are labeled:\n\n\u2022 Topset slope: This is the upper, relatively flat region where coarser sediment settles first as water velocity decreases upon entering the reservoir.\n\n\u2022 Foreset slope: Downstream from the topset area, the diagram shows a steeper sloping layer. This is where sediment cascades down the front of the delta and deposits on the slope, forming inclined layers.\n\n\u2022 Bottomset slope: Farther downslope, in the deeper part of the reservoir, the slope becomes gentler. Finer sediments settle here, creating the lower, flatter portion of the delta deposit.\n\n\u2022 Delta: The main body of accumulated sediment, occupying the transition between the inflow area and the deeper reservoir.\n\n\u2022 Toe: The lowest front edge of the advancing delta, where the foreset beds meet the bottomset region.\n\nThe diagram also includes two horizontal reference lines:\n\n\u2022 Mean operating elevation: The normal water level at which the reservoir is typically maintained.\n\n\u2022 Top of flood control pool: A higher water level marking the maximum elevation used for flood management.\n\nTo the far right, the diagram shows the steep reservoir wall or dam abutment area, with water filling the deep basin between the inflow point on the left and the structure on the right.\n\nOverall, the image illustrates how sediment deposits stratify and shift shape as they progress from shallow to deep water within a reservoir system.",

It notes that a transformer layer has a self\u2011attention block followed by a two\u2011layer MLP block.\n\nThe section first describes how to parallelize the MLP block. It introduces a matrix multiplication followed by a GeLU nonlinearity and explains two different ways of partitioning the weight matrix A: splitting it along rows or along columns. Equations are shown:\n\nY = GeLU(XA)\n\nX is defined as concatenation of submatrices [X1, X2], and A is shown in sub\u2011blocks A1 and A2. The text discusses synchronization points required depending on how partitioning is done. Then it explains the \u201cconjugate operators\u201d f and g, used to reduce synchronization between GPUs. There is a small code block showing an example PyTorch implementation of function f, using all_reduce on the backward pass.\n\nNext, the text describes model parallelism in the self\u2011attention block. It states that key, query, and value matrices are partitioned so that each GPU handles attention heads independently. It highlights that this reduces the need for immediate communication between GPUs. After attention, the linear output layer is parallelized differently, splitting along rows.\n\nTwo diagrams appear on the right side of the page:\n\n\u2022 Diagram (a), labeled \u201cMLP,\u201d shows the flow of tensors through a two\u2011layer perceptron. It uses rectangular blocks connected by arrows. The matrices X, A1, A2, Y, Z, and B are depicted. The diagram visually illustrates splitting the GEMM operation, applying GeLU, and how outputs are reduced or concatenated.\n\n\u2022 Diagram (b), labeled \u201cSelf\u2011Attention,\u201d shows the transformer self\u2011attention block. It shows inputs being split into Q, K, and V branches. Each branch is partitioned into multiple parallel attention heads. The diagram shows multiple colored blocks for split computations and then an output projection layer.\n\nUnder Figure 3, a caption explains that f and g are conjugate operators, with f acting as identity in forward and all\u2011reduce in backward, while g does the opposite.\n\nThe final paragraph on the page discusses the transformer\u2019s embedding matrix and how vocabulary dimension V can be very large. Because vocabularies often have tens of thousands of tokens, they explain that it is useful to parallelize the word embedding matrix along the vocabulary dimension.\n\nOverall, the page mixes descriptive text, mathematical expressions, code, and diagrams to explain how Megatron-LM parallelizes transformer layers across multiple GPUs.",

It contains text and diagrams, not photos of people.\n\nHere is a detailed description of the contents:\n\nThe top contains the heading: \"How Tensor Parallel works?\"\n\nBelow the heading, there is a paragraph explaining that Tensor Parallelism (TP) was first proposed in the Megatron\u2011LM paper. It describes TP as a model parallelism technique used for training large Transformer models. It also mentions Sequence Parallelism (SP), which is presented as a variation of Tensor Parallelism that shards certain layers\u2014specifically LayerNorm or RMSNorm\u2014across the sequence dimension. This technique saves activation memory, which becomes critical as models grow. The paragraph explains that Tensor Parallel training often uses Sequence Parallel on normalization layers to reduce memory bottlenecks.\n\nBelow the text, there are two main labeled diagrams:\n\nSection (a) MLP:\nThis diagram represents how a Multi\u2011Layer Perceptron layer is sharded.  \nIt shows:\n\u2022 An input tensor X  \n\u2022 A weight matrix A that is split into two parts, A1 and A2  \n\u2022 Two parallel linear transformations XA1 and XA2 drawn as separate colored blocks  \n\u2022 Outputs Y1 and Y2 that are concatenated to produce Y  \n\u2022 A second linear transformation B, split into B1 and B2  \n\u2022 After dropout and parallel computation, Z1 and Z2 are produced  \n\u2022 The output Z is formed by combining Z1 and Z2  \n\nThe diagram uses arrows, colored blocks, and labels to depict how matrix multiplications are split across parallel devices.\n\nSection (b) Self\u2011Attention:\nThis diagram shows how self\u2011attention layers are sharded. It includes:\n\u2022 Input X being split and passed into Q, K, and V projections  \n\u2022 Each projection matrix (for Q, K, and V) being sharded into segments labeled k1, k2, k3, etc.  \n\u2022 Separate colored paths representing sharded attention heads  \n\u2022 The attention computation is shown with blocks labeled Q, K, V and softmax operations  \n\u2022 Outputs from multiple shards are combined  \n\u2022 A final sharded projection B (similar to the MLP diagram) that produces Z1 and Z2  \n\u2022 The final output Z is created by combining B1 and B2  \n\nThe figure caption reads:  \n\"Figure 1. represents the sharding in Tensor Parallel style on a Transformer model\u2019s MLP and Self-Attention layer, where the matrix multiplications in both attention/MLP happens through sharded computations (image source).\"\n\nBelow the diagrams is a section titled: \"At a high level, PyTorch Tensor Parallel works as follows:\"\n\nTwo subsections follow:\n\nSharding initialization:\n\u2022 Determine which ParallelStyle to apply to each layer and shard the initialized module by calling parallelize_module.  \n\u2022 The parallelized modules have their parameters converted into DTensors, which handle distributed computation.\n\nRuntime forward/backward:\n\u2022 Depending on the DTensor layouts for each ParallelStyle, the system performs communication operations like all_reduce, all_gather, and reduce_scatter to transform input and output layouts.  \n\u2022 Shared computation is used for parallelized layers such as linear layers and embedding layers to save computation and memory.\n\nOverall, the image is a technical explanation of Tensor Parallelism with clear labeled diagrams illustrating how computations in Transformer MLP and attention layers are split across devices.",

The diagram shows two rows of light\u2011blue circular icons that represent GPUs, labeled cuda:0 through cuda:7.  \n\u2022 The top row represents Tensor Parallelism spreading horizontally across GPUs 0\u20137.  \n\u2022 The left side of the diagram labels the vertical dimension as Fully Sharded Data Parallelism.  \n\u2022 The leftmost column shows another set of GPUs labeled cuda:0 through cuda:7, representing that FSDP spans multiple hosts, each host containing its own group of TP GPUs.\n\nBeneath the diagram is a caption explaining: \u201cFSDP and TP work on separate device dimensions, FSDP communication happens inter\u2011host and TP communication happens intra\u2011host.\u201d\n\nFollowing that is text explaining that this configuration can be represented using a 2\u2011D DeviceMesh with separate sub\u2011meshes for TP and DP.\n\nThere is a code example showing how to initialize the device mesh and apply the two forms of parallelism:\n\n\u2022 It imports the necessary modules from PyTorch: init_device_mesh, ColwiseParallel, RowwiseParallel, parallelize_module, and FullyShardedDataParallel.  \n\u2022 A device mesh is created with shape (8, 8), representing 64 GPUs arranged into an 8\u2011way data parallel dimension and an 8\u2011way tensor parallel dimension.  \n\u2022 The mesh is indexed to extract the tensor\u2011parallel (tp_mesh) and data\u2011parallel (dp_mesh) sub\u2011meshes.  \n\u2022 A model is created.  \n\u2022 Tensor Parallelism is applied to the model using parallelize_module.  \n\u2022 FSDP is applied on top of the tensor\u2011parallelized model using the data\u2011parallel mesh.\n\nAt the bottom, additional text explains that this approach enables TP within each host and FSDP across hosts, requiring zero code changes to the model itself.
