  "doc_001": "This image displays a line graph comparing the performance of two different network routing strategies: \"closeness\" and \"regular\". The graph illustrates the relationship between network delay and throughput.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the graph:\n\n- **Axes:**\n  - The **x-axis** is labeled \"Throughput (Packet Delivery Ratio)\" and ranges from 40 to 75.\n  - The **y-axis** is labeled \"Delay (ms)\" and ranges from 5 to 11 milliseconds.\n\n- **Data Series:**\n  - **Closeness (Blue Line):** This line, marked with blue circles, shows a decreasing trend. As throughput increases from approximately 45 to 72, the delay decreases from about 10.5 ms to 6.1 ms.\n  - **Regular (Black Line):** This line, marked with black circles, also shows a decreasing trend. As throughput increases from approximately 45 to 70, the delay decreases from about 8.2 ms to 5.5 ms.\n\n- **Key Observations:**\n  - The \"closeness\" strategy consistently exhibits a higher delay than the \"regular\" strategy across the entire range of throughput shown.\n  - The \"regular\" strategy achieves a lower delay at any given throughput level.\n  - The graph includes a horizontal dashed red line labeled \"Buys 15% Throughput\". This line is positioned at a delay of approximately 7 ms and intersects the \"closeness\" line at a throughput of about 65. This suggests that the \"closeness\" strategy sacrifices 15% of its throughput to achieve a lower delay, or that it achieves a 15% improvement in throughput at the cost of higher delay.\n\nIn summary, the graph compares two routing strategies, showing that the \"regular\" strategy provides lower delay than the \"closeness\" strategy for the same level of throughput. The \"closeness\" strategy appears to be more sensitive to changes in throughput, resulting in higher delays.",

Motivation & Overview**\nThis section introduces the core problem and the proposed solution.\n- **Problem:** Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) primarily use CLIP as a vision encoder. However, CLIP features have limitations, such as losing visual details. The poster provides two examples:\n    - **Image 1:** A dog in a field. A question asks if the dog is facing left or right from the camera's perspective. The correct answer, \"facing to the right,\" is based on the position of the tail and the orientation of the body, which are details that CLIP might not capture well.\n    - **Image 2:** A red pillar box. A question asks if any windows are visible. The correct answer is \"no,\" as the pillar box is a type of mailbox with no windows. The image shows a \"no windows visible\" label, highlighting the need for accurate object recognition.\n- **Solution:** To address this, the research investigates aligning features from pretrained diffusion models with the LLM. The key idea is that diffusion models are trained with larger resolution and are more interpretable, which can lead to better performance.\n- **Key Finding:** The study shows that with limited training data, similar performance can be achieved by replacing the contrastive-trained CLIP encoder with a generative diffusion model encoder.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

It is described as having fast-growing leaves and a long, white, napiform root. The text notes its origin in continental East Asia, its consumption throughout East and South Asia, and its international availability. It also mentions that daikon is sometimes planted to break up compacted soils and recover nutrients, without being harvested.\n\n- **Names Section**: This section details the various names for the vegetable in different languages and contexts.\n    - **Culinary Contexts**: The most common English names are \"daikon\" (from Japanese: \u5927\u6839, lit. 'big root') and \"daikon radish.\" The term \"mooli\" (Hindi: \u092e\u0942\u0932\u0940, romanized: m\u016bl\u012b) is noted as a general synonym in English, particularly with historical ties to South Asia. Other common terms include \"white radish,\" \"winter radish,\" \"Oriental radish,\" and \"long white radish.\" When distinguishing the Japanese variety, it is sometimes called \"Japanese radish.\"\n    - **Chinese Names**: The article explains that Chinese names are uncommon in English. In most Chinese cuisines, it is known as *b\u00e1i lu\u00f3bo* (white radish). In Cantonese and Malaysian cuisines, it is called *lobak* or *lo pak*. In Hokkien and Teochew-speaking areas (e.g., Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), it is known as *chai tow* or *chai tau* (\u83dc\u982d). It is sometimes marketed as \"icicle radish\" in English-speaking countries.\n    - **Other Names**: The text notes that in mainland China and Singapore, the misnomer \"calque white carrot\" or \"misnomer carrot\" is used due to the similarity of names in Mandarin and Hokkien.

The figure is divided into two main parts, labeled (1) and (2), depicting a two-stage process for improving a large language model (LLM) through a technique called DPO (Direct Preference Optimization).\n\n---\n\n### **Part (1): CoT Data Generation and Off-Policy DPO**\n\nThis section outlines the initial phase of the ExCoT process, where a dataset of high-quality, verified examples is created to train a model.\n\n- **Input:** The process begins with a set of **Questions**.\n- **LLM API Service:** The questions are fed into a **LLM API Service** (specifically, GPT-4o is used in the experiment) using **CoT Prompting** (Chain-of-Thought prompting). This prompts the LLM to generate a step-by-step reasoning process and a final answer.\n- **Candidate CoT Data:** The output from the LLM is **Candidate CoT Data**, which includes the generated reasoning chain and the answer.\n- **Execution and Verification:** This candidate data is then **Executed** on a local SQLite database. The system extracts the SQL query from the CoT reasoning and runs it against the database.\n- **Database (DB):** The database stores the ground truth data. The results from the executed SQL query are compared against the actual expected results to **Verify results**.\n- **Positive and Negative Examples:**\n    - If the result is correct, the entire CoT data is labeled as a **Positive Example**.\n    - If the result is incorrect, it is labeled as a **Negative Example**.\n- **Model Training:** The **Positive Examples** are used to **supervised fine-tune (SFT)** the **Base Model**. This creates a new model, the **SFT Model**.\n- **Off-Policy DPO:** The **SFT Model** is then used to generate a dataset of **Candidate CoT Data**. This data is used to create **pairs** of positive and negative examples, which are then used to train an **Off-Policy DPO Model**. The \"off-policy\" aspect means the model is trained on data generated by a different policy (the SFT model) than the one it is currently learning.\n\n---\n\n### **Part (2): On-Policy Iterative DPO",

The prompts are formatted as a conversation between a \"System\" and a \"User,\" which is a common structure for instructing large language models.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Non-Chain-of-Thought Prompt\n\nThis is the simplest prompt template, designed to elicit a direct SQL query without any intermediate reasoning steps.\n\n- **System:** \"You are an AI assistant helping a data analyst write SQL queries to answer questions.\"\n- **User:** The user provides a database schema and a question. The instruction is to write a single SQL query that answers the question, which must be enclosed in triple backticks (````sql ... ````). The prompt does not require any explanation or thought process.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Chain-of-Thought Prompt\n\nThis template introduces the concept of a \"chain-of-thought\" by asking the AI to explicitly show its reasoning process before providing the final answer.\n\n- **System:** \"You are an AI assistant helping a data analyst write SQL queries to answer questions.\"\n- **User:** The user provides a database schema and a question. The instruction is to write out the thought process in detail, followed by the final SQL query enclosed in triple backticks. This prompt encourages the AI to \"think step-by-step\" before outputting the code.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompt (Divide and Conquer)\n\nThis is the most sophisticated template, explicitly implementing a \"divide and conquer\" strategy for problem-solving. It breaks down the task into a multi-step process.\n\n- **System:** \"As a Text2SQL assistant, your main task is to formulate an SQL query in response to a given natural language inquiry. This process involves a chain-of-thought (CoT) approach, which includes a 'divide and conquer' strategy.\"\n    - The system explains that the process has three phases:\n        1.  **Divide:** Break the question into smaller, manageable sub-problems using pseudo-SQL queries.\n        2.  **Conquer:** Aggregate the solutions to these sub-problems to form the final response.",
