The slide is divided into several sections, each with its own heading and corresponding content:\n\n1. **Motivation & Overview**:\n   - Current Large Multimodal Models (LMM) predominantly utilize CLIP as vision encoder to extract image features.\n   - However, CLIP feature has many limitations due to loss of visual details.\n   - To leverage this issue, we investigate the alignment of features from pretrained diffusion models to LLM.\n   - Diffusion model is trained with larger resolution and more interpretable objective.\n   - With limited training data, we achieve similar performance with replacing contrastive trained CLIP encoder by generative diffusion model encoder.\n\n2. **Methods & Experiments**:\n   - We freeze the language model for stage 1 and train projector + LLM for stage 2.\n   - Force Alignment:\n     - Uses diffusion features to replace CLIP features.\n     - Tests on Stable Diffusion 1.5 & 2.1 and Image Variation Diffusion.\n   - Efficient Alignment:\n     - Mixes diffusion features and CLIP feature in interleaved format along the token level.\n     - Both alignment techniques have similar performance as using CLIP features.\n\n3. **Datasets & Metrics**:\n   - Training Data:\n     - LLVA 558k for stage 1 projector alignment.\n     - LLVA 665k for stage 2 instruction finetuning.\n     - ShareGPT4V 1M caption for data scaling up experiments.\n   - Evaluation:\n     - POPE [2], an object existence benchmark, is evaluated.\n     - In POPE, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score are the main evaluation metrics.\n     - Additionally, yes ratio is one signal reflecting the influence by data distribution.\n\n4. **Discussion & Future Research**:\n   - Diffusion models with worse generation performance show better performance on VLM. A possible explanation is that rich visual details make alignment more difficult.\n   - For efficient alignment, blending noise with CLIP has the same performance as the baseline. We question the real impact of I-Mo raised in Tong's paper [1].\n   - Data: LLaVA dataset is more carefully filtered to align with the POPE benchmark\u2019s distribution than ShareGPT4V.\n   - Diffusion feature: SD 2",

The graph is plotted on a coordinate system with the x-axis labeled \"Vacuum Level (mm Hg)\" and the y-axis labeled \"Flow Rate (liters/sec).\" \n\nKey elements of the graph include:\n\n1. **Blower Curve**: This is represented by a curved line that starts at a higher vacuum level and decreases in slope as the vacuum level decreases. This curve illustrates the relationship between vacuum level and flow rate when the valves are fully open and the system is at its most efficient operating condition.\n\n2. **System Curves**: These are represented by a series of connected points and lines. The first point labeled \"Valves Fully Open\" is connected to a point labeled \"System Curves\" on the graph. The curve then follows a slightly different path, indicating the relationship between vacuum level and flow rate when the valves are partially closed to balance the flow.\n\n3. **Flow Rate at Different Vacuum Levels**: The graph shows the flow rate at specific vacuum levels. For example, the point labeled \"Q1\" represents the flow rate when the vacuum level is at a certain point on the x-axis, and the point labeled \"Q2\" represents another specific flow rate at a different vacuum level.\n\nThe graph effectively demonstrates how changes in vacuum level affect the flow rate in a pneumatic system, illustrating the trade-offs between vacuum level and flow rate. The blower curve indicates the maximum flow rate achievable at different vacuum levels when valves are fully open, while the system curves show how adjusting the valves to balance the flow impacts the flow rate at various vacuum levels.",

This implies a translation of 2 units to the right (x-direction) and 2 units up (y-direction).\n\n2. **Scaling**:\n   - The cat's height increased by 50%. If the original height was 2 units, the new height is \\(2 + 0.5 \\times 2 = 3\\) units.\n   - Since the cat is now sitting on a taller cat tree, we need to assume the cat tree's height also increased by 50%. However, the problem does not specify the new height of the cat tree, so we assume it is scaled together with the cat.\n\n### Sequence of Transformations:\n1. Translate the cat 2 units to the right and 2 units up.\n2. Scale the cat to 3 units tall.\n3. Scale the cat tree to match the new height",

This is achieved through an adaptive classification mechanism that optimizes the attention patterns based on the input data.\n  \n- **Attention Heads**: In video diffusion transformers, attention heads are the key components responsible for capturing the relationships between different parts of the video. The spatial and temporal heads are designed to focus on local and global spatial/temporal patterns, respectively.\n\n- **Online Profiling**: The online profiling strategy involves extracting a small portion of the query matrix \\( Q \\) and using it to compute both spatial and temporal attention. This is done to ensure that the attention computation is efficient and accurate. The MSE metric is used to compare the results of full attention with either spatial or temporal attention, helping to determine the optimal attention pattern.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe SVG framework leverages the adaptive classification of attention heads based on their spatial and temporal sparsity to significantly reduce the computational cost of video diffusion transformers. This approach ensures that the model can efficiently",

Introduction**:\nWe take advantage of the structure of transformer networks to create a simple model parallel implementation by adding a few synchronization primitives. A transformer layer consists of a self attention block followed by a two-layer, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as shown in Figure 2. We introduce model parallelism in both of these blocks separately.\n\nWe start by detailing the MLP block. The first part of the block is a GEMM followed by a GeLU nonlinearity:\n\n```python\nY = GeLU(XA)\n```\n\nOne option to parallelize the GEMM is to split the weight matrix A along its columns and the input X along its rows as:\n\n```python\nX = [X1, X2], A = [[A1], [A2]]\n```\n\nThis partitioning will result in Y = GeLU(X1A1 + X2A2). Since GeLU is a non-linear function, GeLU(X1A1 + X2A2) != GeLU(X1A1) + GeLU(X2A2) and this approach will require a synchronization point before the GeLU function.\n\nAnother option is to split A along its columns. This partitioning allows the GeLU nonlinearity to be independently applied to the output of each partitioned GEMM:\n\n```python\n[Y1, Y2] = [GeLU(XA1), GeLU(XA2)]\n```\n\nThis is advantageous as it removes a synchronization point. Hence, we partition the first GEMM in this column parallel fashion and split the second GEMM along its rows so it takes the output of the GeLU layer directly without requiring any communication as shown in Figure 3a. The output of the second GEMM is then reduced across the GPUs before passing the output",

The temperature is measured in degrees Celsius (deg C) and is plotted on the y-axis, while the time is plotted on the x-axis in days.\n\n### Details of the Graph:\n1. **Y-Axis (Temperature):**\n   - The temperature scale ranges from 10\u00b0C to 120\u00b0C.\n   - The temperature increases linearly over time for all three layers, indicating a consistent heating process.\n\n2. **X-Axis (Time):**\n   - The time scale ranges from 0 to 60 days.\n\n3. **Three Lines Representing Different Thicknesses:**\n   - **1 m thick layer (Red Line, Solid):**\n     - The temperature increases rapidly for the first few days, then levels off and shows a steady increase over time.\n   - **2 m thick layer (Green Line, Solid):**\n     - Similar to the 1 m thick layer, the temperature increases rapidly initially, levels off, and continues to rise slowly over time.\n   - **3 m thick layer (Blue Line, Dashed):**\n     - The temperature increases more slowly compared to the 1 m thick and 2 m thick layers. The heating process is slower, and the temperature increases more gradually over time.\n\n### Additional Information:\n- **Steam Temperature:**\n  - The steam temperature above and below the layer is 120\u00b0C.\n  \n- **Ambient Temperature:**\n  - The ambient temperature is 10\u00b0C.\n\n- **Soil Diffusivity:**\n  - The soil diffusivity is given as \\(5.82 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\).\n\n### Analysis:\nFrom the graph, it is evident that the thickness of the impermeable layer significantly affects the rate and duration of temperature increase. The 1 m thick layer reaches a higher temperature more quickly than the 2 m thick layer, and the 2 m thick layer reaches a higher temperature than the 3 m thick layer. This indicates that the larger the thickness of the impermeable layer, the slower the rate of temperature increase, which is indicative of slower heat conduction through the",

This figure illustrates how the reflectance of the soil varies with the soil's moisture, texture, and composition in the visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, as measured by the ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) Spectral Library.\n\n### Detailed Description:\n\n1. **Title and Labels:**\n   - The title at the top reads \"Spectral Reflectance Curve for Brown Soil.\" \n   - A subtitle in a white box below the title states, \"Soilspectra vary with the soils moisture, texture, and composition. This is just one example.\"\n   - The x-axis is labeled \"Wavelength (\u00b5m)\" and ranges from 0.3 to 2.5 micrometers.\n   - The y-axis is labeled \"Reflectance\" and ranges from 0 to 100, indicating the intensity of the reflected light.\n\n2. **Graph Details:**\n   - The curve shows a general trend where the reflectance increases with wavelength, reaching a peak around 1.5 micrometers. \n   - There are two distinct absorption bands marked on the graph:\n     - At 1.4 micrometers, there is a notable absorption, likely due to the absorption by clay minerals in the soil.\n     - At 1.9 micrometers, another absorption band is indicated, likely due to the absorption by water, which is common in soil spectra.\n\n3. **Color Legend:**\n   - There is a color legend at the bottom of the graph, with two colors:\n     - Blue: representing the visible spectrum (0.4 to 0.7 micrometers).\n     - Red: representing near-infrared spectrum (0.7 to 2.5 micrometers).\n\n4. **Notes:**\n   - The graph notes that the reflectance in the visible part increases with wavelength, which is a common characteristic of most soils.\n   - The absorption bands at 1.4 and 1.9 micrometers are highlighted, indicating specific absorption by clay minerals and water, respectively.\n\n### Interpretation:\n\nThis spectral reflectance curve provides a visual representation of how brown soils reflect different wavelengths of light, which can be used for soil monitoring and analysis. The high reflectance in the visible spectrum suggests that brown soils absorb more strongly in the",

The image is divided into four main sections: Source, Interaction, Receptors, and Geographical Information System (GIS).\n\n### Source\nThe source section shows a contaminant, specifically TCE (Trichloroethylene), which is present in soil. The TCE can diffuse into the environment through various mechanisms such as volatilization, fugitive dust, and leaching. Dermal contact and ingestion are listed as exposure routes for workers and residents, indicating possible human exposure pathways.\n\n### Interaction\nThe interaction section details the pathways by which the contaminant can move through the environment:\n1. **Volatilization** - TCE can be released into the air as a vapor.\n2. **Fugitive Dust** - TCE can be released into the air when dust containing the contaminant is disturbed.\n3. **Leaching** - TCE can dissolve in water and move through the soil matrix, potentially ending up in groundwater.\n\nEach of these mechanisms is visually represented by arrows pointing towards different media and exposure routes. The media listed include air, soil, and groundwater.\n\n### Receptors\nThe receptors section identifies different types of human receptors and their associated exposure paths:\n- **Current Worker** - Exposed through dermal contact and ingestion.\n- **Future Worker** - Exposed through similar pathways.\n- **Resident** - Exposed through dermal contact, ingestion, and vapor inhalation.\n\nThis section is color-coded to differentiate between potentially complete pathways and incomplete pathways.\n\n### Geographical Information System (GIS)\nThe GIS section illustrates how different layers of information can be related to the contamination exposure pathways:\n- **Receptor/Land Use Layer** - Shows how different land uses (e.g., recreational use, agricultural use) affect potential exposure routes.\n- **Exposure Media Layer** - Highlights how the contaminants move through different media (e.g., surface water, soil).\n- **Source (Contamination) Layer** - Illustrates where the contaminant is located (e.g., within the soil, within surface water).\n- **Base Site Map** - Provides the geographical context of the contamination site.\n\n### Figure 2-6.

  "doc_152": "This image is a graph titled \"Figure 2-23. The Three Temperature Zones that Form During a Steam Flood.\" The graph illustrates the spatial distribution of contaminants and their temperature zones within a subsurface environment, specifically during a process known as a steam flood. This process is often used in enhanced oil recovery methods. The x-axis represents \"Distance from Injection Well,\" and the y-axis represents \"Contaminant Saturation.\"\n\nThe graph is divided into three distinct temperature zones, as follows:\n\n1. **Zone 1: Steam Temperature Zone**\n   - This zone is marked with a peak on the y-axis, indicating the highest level of contaminant saturation. This zone is characterized by the presence of a volatile component, likely steam, which displaces contaminants.\n\n2. **Zone 2: Variable Temperature Zone**\n   - This zone has a slope, indicating a gradual transition in contaminant saturation. The temperature here is variable, potentially influenced by the interaction of steam and the subsurface rock.\n\n3. **Zone 3: Ambient Temperature Zone**\n   - This zone is the least saturated with contaminants, with a slight peak but generally lower than the peak in Zone 1. This zone is influenced by the ambient temperature of the surrounding environment.\n\nThe graph also includes annotations to help understand the points of interest:\n- **Contaminant Bank containing volatile components** - This indicates the presence of contaminants that are volatile, meaning they evaporate easily.\n- **Hot water bank** - This suggests the presence of hot water flowing through the system.\n- **Contaminants displaced by viscous forces** - This refers to the displacement of contaminants by the forces of viscosity, which can vary depending on the temperature and pressure conditions.\n\nThe graph is sourced from Wu (1977) and is used with permission, as indicated by the text \"From Wu 1977, copyright Society of Petroleum Engineers, used with permission.\"\n\nIn summary, the graph visually represents the three distinct temperature zones formed during a steam flood process, highlighting the varying levels of contaminant saturation and the conditions influencing the contamination levels in each zone. This graphical representation is crucial for understanding the behavior of contaminants during such processes, particularly in the context of oil recovery and environmental considerations.",

  "doc_154": "This image is a diagram labeled Figure 4-34 and is titled \"TDEM: apparent resistivity, two-layered earth.\" The diagram illustrates the behavior of apparent resistivity (\\(\\rho_{A}(t)\\)) over time, considering a two-layered earth model. There are two graphs shown in the figure.\n\n### Graph (a)\n- **Label**: \\(\\rho_{2} > \\rho_{1}\\)\n- **Description**: The graph shows that the apparent resistivity decreases rapidly at first and then approaches a plateau value as time progresses.\n\n### Graph (b)\n- **Label**: \\(\\rho_{2} < \\rho_{1}\\)\n- **Description**: This graph illustrates an overshoot in the apparent resistivity. Initially, the apparent resistivity decreases at a slow rate, then it increases sharply at a certain point \\(t^{+}\\) and then returns to its initial value.\n\n### Interpretation\n- **Graph (a)**: In this case, the lower layer (with higher resistivity \\(\\rho_{2}\\)) is more resistive than the upper layer (with lower resistivity \\(\\rho_{1}\\)). The resistivity of the upper layer (\\(\\rho_{1}\\)) is initially higher than the resistivity of the lower layer (\\(\\rho_{2}\\)), but over time, the resistivity of the upper layer decreases more rapidly due to the higher resistivity of the lower layer.\n- **Graph (b)**: In this scenario, the lower layer has a resistivity (\\(\\rho_{2}\\)) that is lower than the upper layer (\\(\\rho_{1}\\)). Initially, the apparent resistivity decreases at a slower rate than in graph (a). However, at a specific time \\(t^{+}\\), the apparent resistivity overshoots its initial value before returning to its original level. This overshoot indicates that the lower layer's resistance is significantly lower than the upper layer, leading to a higher apparent resistivity during the initial phase.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe TDEM (Time-Domain Electromagnetic) method is used to infer the electrical properties of subsurface materials, particularly the resistivity of different layers. The diagrams show the variations in apparent resistivity over time in two-layered earth models, which can help in understanding the internal structure and composition of the earth's layers.",

The document mentions the benefits of using a Fast Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) and Tensor Parallelism (TP) together, noting that while Tensor Parallelism involves communications that can block computation, FSDP is designed to run within a fast communication channel such as NVLink.\n\nThe diagram is used to illustrate how FSDP and TP work on separate device dimensions. FSDP communication happens between the hosts, while TP communication happens within a single host.\n\nThe text also notes that this 2-D parallelism pattern can be easily expressed via a 2-D DeviceMesh. It explains that each \"sub\" DeviceMesh is passed to each individual parallelism API as a parameter.\n\n### Code Snippet:\nAt the bottom of the document, there is a code snippet demonstrating how to implement the combination of TP and FSDP in a Python script. The code uses the `torch.distributed` library to set up the device mesh and apply the parallelization modules for TP and FSDP.\n\n```python\nfrom torch.distributed.device_mesh import init_device_mesh\nfrom torch.distributed.tensor.parallel import ColwiseParallel, RowwiseParallel, parallelize_module\nfrom torch.distributed.fsdp import FullyShardedDataParallel as FSDP\n\n# Initialize the 2-D mesh for TP\nmesh_2d = init_device_mesh(\"cuda\", (8, 8))\ntp_mesh = mesh_2d[\"tp\"]\ndp_mesh = mesh_2d[\"dp\"]\n\nmodel = Model(...)\n\ntp_plan = {...}",
  "doc_175": "The image presents a diagram illustrating the process of applying loss parallelism in a machine learning model, specifically focusing on the computation of cross-entropy loss. The diagram is divided into several sections, each representing different stages of the computation process.\n\n### Overview of the Diagram\n\n1. **Input Phase**:\n   - The diagram starts with an \"input\" block, which represents the input data to the model. This input is then divided into batches. Each batch is further divided into sub-batches, as indicated by the dashed lines that split the input into smaller segments.\n\n2. **Model Processing**:\n   - Within each sub-batch, the model processes the data. This is indicated by the arrows connecting the input to the model, showing the flow of data through the model. The model outputs are then reshaped into tensors, as shown by the red arrows labeled \"all-reduce.\"\n\n3. **All-Reduce Operation**:\n   - The \"all-reduce\" operation is a communication step where all GPUs involved in the training process exchange their model outputs. This operation is crucial for ensuring that all GPUs have the same data during the loss computation. The all-reduce operation is represented by the red arrows connecting the sub-batches on different GPUs.\n\n4. **Target Phase**:\n   - The target values are input into the model. These values are also divided into sub-batches and processed similarly as the input data.\n\n5. **Loss Calculation**:\n   - The loss computation is performed on the model outputs and the target values. The cross-entropy loss function is used, as indicated by the \"aten.log_softmax\" and \"aten.nll_loss_forward\" operations. These operations are performed on the sub-batches, and the results are again summed up and reduced across the GPUs using the same all-reduce operation.\n\n### Key Elements of the Diagram\n\n- **Batch and Sub-batches**:\n  - The input data is divided into batches, and each batch is further divided into sub-batches. This helps in parallelizing the computation.\n\n- **Model Processing**:\n  - The model processes the data in sub-batches, and the outputs are reshaped into tensors for communication.\n\n- **All-Reduce Operation**:\n  - The all-reduce operation is used to ensure that all GPUs have the same data during the loss computation. This step is crucial for accuracy in distributed training.\n\n- **Target Values**:\n  - The target values are processed in a similar manner to",

Here is the detailed description of the flowchart:\n\n1. **Start**: \n    - The algorithm begins with a start node.\n\n2. **Input Parameters**:\n    - The first step involves initializing the input parameters. This includes specifying the data flow graph D, the workload W, and the total number of devices N.\n\n3. **Dataflow Initialization**:\n    - After initializing the input parameters, the dataflow graph is initialized.\n    - The graph is then analyzed to determine the necessary steps and transitions, which are likely defined by the dataflow graph D.\n\n4. **Mapping**:\n    - The next step involves mapping the workload W onto the available devices N.\n    - This is likely done by grouping the workload into tasks that can be efficiently executed on individual devices.\n\n5. **Decision**:\n    - Based on the mapping, a decision is made to determine the optimal device placement for each part of the workload.\n    - This decision is likely based on factors such as computational requirements, device capabilities, and communication overhead.\n\n6. **Final Mapping**:\n    - After making the decision, the final mapping is determined.\n    - This provides the optimal allocation of tasks to devices, ensuring efficient dataflow execution.\n\n7. **End**:\n    - The algorithm concludes with an end node, indicating the completion of the process.\n\n### CoT Explanation\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n    - The algorithm starts by gathering input parameters such as the data flow graph D, workload W, and total number of devices N.\n\n2. **Dataflow Analysis**:\n    - The dataflow graph is analyzed to identify the tasks or operations that need to be executed. This might involve breaking down the workload into smaller, more manageable tasks.\n\n3. **Mapping**:\n    - Tasks are then mapped onto the available devices. This involves deciding which tasks should be executed on which device to ensure optimal performance.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n    - At this stage, a decision is made about the most efficient way to allocate tasks. This might involve considering factors such as the computational load, the device\u2019s processing power, and the communication overhead between devices.\n\n5. **Final Mapping**:\n    - Based on the decision, the final mapping is determined.
